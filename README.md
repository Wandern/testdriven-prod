# Microservices with Docker, Flask, and React

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Wandern/testdriven-prod.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Wandern/testdriven-prod)

TODO:
- Add automation for Black and Flake8 in Manage.py as a part of the push/merge/testing process
- Automate GitFlow Repository Management.
** Branching done by issue/task identifier
** Automatic Version numbering
** Unknown automationss
- Sphynx/readthedocs documentation/automation
- Add Documentation for setting up the template/project with Travis CI


In terms of workflow, for now, while the project structure is still somewhat simple, we'll:

1. Code a new feature locally
2. Commit and push code
3. Ensure tests pass on Travis
